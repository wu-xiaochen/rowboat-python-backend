## Contribution Workflow & Best Practices

Whether it's your first contribution or your fiftieth, here's what a great contribution looks like:

| Step / Tip                     | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Fork the Repository**     | Create a personal copy of [rowboatlabs/rowboat](https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat) to start contributing. |
| **2. Create a New Branch**     | Use a descriptive name like `fix-tool-crash` or `feature-new-mcp`. Avoid committing to `main`. |
| **3. Make Your Changes**       | Focus your PR on a single issue or feature to keep things clean and reviewable.               |
| **4. Write Tests if Needed**   | If you change logic, add relevant tests so your contribution is future-proof.                |
| **5. Run Tests & Lint Locally**| Make sure your branch passes all tests and code quality checks before pushing.                |
| **6. Document or Demo It**     | Add helpful context: screenshots, example scripts, or a short video/gif to demonstrate your changes. |
| **7. Submit a Pull Request**   | Open a PR with a clear description of your changes and any context reviewers should know.           |
| **8. Collaborate on Feedback** | Our maintainers may leave comments — it’s all part of the process. Let’s improve it together. |
| **9. Don’t Be Shy to Follow Up** | Feel free to ping the PR/issue if you're waiting on feedback. We appreciate polite nudges.  |
| **10. Celebrate the Merge!**   | You just made Rowboat better. Thanks for contributing 🚀                                      |

<Tip>If you're fixing typos, spacing, or small tweaks — try bundling those into a related PR instead of sending them standalone. It helps keep reviews focused. </Tip>
